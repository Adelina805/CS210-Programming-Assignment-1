Code description:

Node : node container for the Circular Doubly Linked List
PUBLIC MEMBER VARIABLES
   T *data; - data for node
   Node<T> *next; - next pointer for node
   Node<T> *prev; - previous pointer for node
CONSTRUCTORS
   Node(T *data) - default constructor, creates node with some data, sets both pointers to null
PUBLIC MEMBER FUNCTIONS
   void print()
   print: calls the print function, no input or output
   Precondition: State of Program before member function is run
   Postcondition: State of Program after member function is run

CircularDLL : Description of the role or purpose of objects of this class goes here.
PUBLIC MEMBER VARIABLES
data_type Variable_Name; - Purpose of the variable
CONSTRUCTORS
Brief description of the purpose of this constructor; for example, default constructor, copy constructor
Destructor if any. Describe the destructor
PUBLIC MEMBER FUNCTIONS
return_type Function_Name (parameter_list)
Function_Name: brief description of the purpose of this function, it's input, and its output. Also include a brief
description of how the function works if the algorithm is non-trivial.
Precondition: State of Program before member function is run
Postcondition: State of Program after member function is run

Process : Description of the role or purpose of objects of this class goes here.
PUBLIC MEMBER VARIABLES
data_type Variable_Name; - Purpose of the variable
CONSTRUCTORS
Brief description of the purpose of this constructor; for example, default constructor, copy constructor
Destructor if any. Describe the destructor
PUBLIC MEMBER FUNCTIONS
return_type Function_Name (parameter_list)
Function_Name: brief description of the purpose of this function, it's input, and its output. Also include a brief
description of how the function works if the algorithm is non-trivial.
Precondition: State of Program before member function is run
Postcondition: State of Program after member function is run
